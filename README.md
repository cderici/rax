## Rax

A (small subset of) Racket to x86_64 compiler with static type checking and a wanna be GC, written in Racket with some C runtime support.

* Authors: Caner Derici ([cderici](https://github.com/cderici)) and Ryan Scott ([rgscott](https://github.com/rgscott))
* To run the tests, simply invoke `make test` from the top-level directory. (Assumes a Racket binary)
