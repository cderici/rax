Register allocation is good, although it appears that you are
restricting yourself to a subset of the registers available? It seems
that only r9-r15 are used. But these include both caller-save and
callee-save registers and they are handled correctly, so full credit
-- just make sure to fix it if you intended to use all registers.
Move biasing is implemented.

It would be convenient for us (the graders) if you didn't run your own
tests from within compiler.rkt. We import that file externally and
since it's getting executed within a different directory, I have to
comment out your tests in order to run mine. This will not affect your
grade, however.

ASSIGNMENT 3:
23/23 test cases interpreted successfully.
23/23 test cases compiled and executed correctly.
