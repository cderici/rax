(provide uncover-types uncover-types-define)
;; This file provides the uncover-types function which can be used to
;; recover type information for variables in the program body. This
;; function can be used to help simplify the complexity of
;; expose-allocation and uncover-call-live-roots.  Expose-allocation
;; needs the type of each allocated vector in order to correctly tag
;; the vector, and uncover-call-live-roots needs the type information
;; to identify roots at each collection call site.
;;
;; In the match clause for 'program' in expose-allocation, the uncover
;; types function can be called to get an association list mapping
;; variables to types. This map can then be passed as a parameter into
;; expose-allocation so that you can determine the type of a vector
;; needed for 'allocate' by looking up the type of the variable to
;; which that vector is assigned.  After processing the entire program
;; the type environment can be saved for the next pass in the locals
;; slot of the program form.
;;
;; While processing the program form of uncover-call-live-roots, this
;; environment can be retrieved from the locals slot and again passed
;; without change throughout the processing of the body of the
;; program.  When we find a variable in expression possition and the
;; type of the variable is a Vector type then we consider this
;; variable to be a live root.  All such live roots are collected at
;; calls to the collector and stored in the live set. After this pass
;; the original locals form can be restored by taking the car of all
;; pairs in the association list.

;; New!!!!

;; Programs with defines return multiple environments. One for each body
;; of a define. Plus one that includes the top level defines themselves.
;; The environments for each of the bodies includes only locals and
;; not parameters. It should be safe to ignore the global environment
;; of the top level defines because this contains only function types
;; and we are currently only interested in checking for vectors as roots.

;; Here is a minimal example of its use.
